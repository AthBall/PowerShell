PowerShell scripts make managing files easy 

Description: Windows Power Script that automatically classifies files in a folder 

Why? Have you used a personal computer to browse the image folder (DCIM) of the memory card in your cell phone? if yes, you will find the photo gallery messy: All the photos messed up and they are not stored separately by folders. What’s more, if you want to find a specific photo taken on a specific date but you only remember the period (let's say, photo taken in the winter, from Oct to Jan)? Hummm, you may take an hour to check the photos one by one, just as the Death has came to you asking you to replay your (damn?) “life”. "Dying" really takes time, and ironically, you have no time or your gallery contains some things that you don’t want to remember (yea, something just wanna hold without facing; something just wanna do without expectation but you still keep them in your memory, what a human...). Is there a tool that can ease your life? Of cause, this tool cannot help you manage your personal life, but can organize your photos for a swift access. (Hope you can skip the unpleasant =] )

Something you should know: Though the name of the photos contains no logic (it can be a hash number or simply, prefix w/ a counter such as IMG0001), the metadata (the information of the information =] or you can simply think it as a general description of the data) contains one important information - the creation date of the file. This tool based on this meaningful information to classify files and create folders to hold them. 

Functions:
  [Type 1] Quick classification - classify files and create folders to hold them 
  [Type 2] Classification based on name - find files after a user input the name 
  [Type 3] Classification based on file extension - find files after a user input the file type (mp3, doc, docx, etc)

Usage: This tool is not only for managing photos, but also extended to make files in Windows manageble, for example the songs, documents, videos, etc. 

Tools and debugging: this script is developped using Windows 7; PWRShell Major 2, Build and revision -1

Future Work: An GUI?
